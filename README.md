# Form Validation App

This is a web-based **Form Validation App** that provides real-time feedback to users as they fill out a form. It validates user inputs like full name, email, password, phone number, and confirms that passwords match before submission. The app uses **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** to perform client-side validation.

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to create a user-friendly form with real-time validation to ensure data integrity before submission. It demonstrates:
- **JavaScript** validation techniques for various input fields.
- Clear error messages for user guidance.
- Real-time feedback to improve user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the form.
- **CSS**: To style the form and display error messages.
